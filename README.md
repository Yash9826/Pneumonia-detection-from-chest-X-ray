🫁 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays (CNN + Streamlit)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect Pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
It also includes a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions with input validation to ensure the uploaded image is a valid X-ray.

✨ Features
✅ CNN-based image classifier to predict Pneumonia vs. Normal.
✅ Data preprocessing and augmentation (resizing, normalization, flipping, rotation).
✅ Streamlit app for easy user interaction.
✅ Input validation to warn users if the uploaded image does not look like a chest X-ray.
✅ Real-time prediction results with confidence score.

🏗️ Tech Stack
Python 3.x
TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning Model)
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (Data Processing & Visualization)
Streamlit (Web App Deployment)
PIL (Pillow) (Image Processing)
